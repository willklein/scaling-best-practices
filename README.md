# Toolmaking with ASTs
> Slides and material for a potential conference talk

## Proposal

We have complex, challenging problems when we implement our UI. If that wasn't hard enough, there's a myriad of good and bad ways to write our JavaScript-and it keeps evolving! ES6 is here, ES7 is showing up, and guess what, those are now called ES2015, ES2016, and there will be a 17, 18, 19...

Fortunately, there is also a revolution in JavaScript tooling. New tools are here to help us understand and improve our code. Let's look at one of these tools, ESLint, and peek under the hood! But first, let's also rediscover how languages are parsed, analyzed, and represented as abstract syntax trees.

During this session, we'll learn to reason about ASTs to detect good and bad patterns in computer language. To drive this home, we'll build our own tools by writing custom rules in ESLint.
